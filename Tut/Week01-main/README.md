# Graph Representation, Traversal and MSTÂ¶

Hi! Welcome to COMP9418. In this course we will learn about Machine Learning models that use graphs and probabilities to represent and answer queries about applications that involve uncertainty.

During out course, we will develop our library of Graphical Models. The purpose of this library is two-fold. First, it will help us to understand and practice the concepts seen in lectures. Second, it will be the basis to implement assignments.

Let's get started. In this week, we will implement a library with some important operations over graphs.
